# Service Refactoring Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for refactoring the PDF processing backend services to use a standardized file management approach.

## Overview

The refactoring initiative aims to:
- Standardize file handling across all services
- Replace direct file operations with the unified `FileManagementService`
- Deprecate the legacy `FileManager` class
- Establish consistent patterns for file management throughout the application

## Documentation Structure

### üìã [file_management_standardization_spec.md](./file_management_standardization_spec.md)
**Primary specification document**
- Current state analysis of all services
- Target architecture and patterns
- Detailed comparison of existing vs. target implementations
- Benefits and risk mitigation strategies

### üìù [refactoring_tasks.md](./refactoring_tasks.md)
**Detailed implementation tasks**
- Phase-by-phase refactoring tasks
- Specific code changes for each service
- Before/after code examples
- Validation checklists and rollback procedures

### üõ†Ô∏è [implementation_guidelines.md](./implementation_guidelines.md)
**Implementation standards and migration strategy**
- Code standards and patterns
- Error handling and logging guidelines
- Testing standards and examples
- Performance guidelines
- Complete migration strategy with timelines

## Quick Start

1. **Read the Specification**: Start with `file_management_standardization_spec.md` to understand the overall approach
2. **Review Tasks**: Check `refactoring_tasks.md` for specific implementation steps
3. **Follow Guidelines**: Use `implementation_guidelines.md` for coding standards and migration process

## Services to be Refactored

| Service | Status | Risk Level | Timeline |
|---------|--------|------------|----------|
| OCRService | ‚ùå Needs Refactoring | Low | 1-2 days |
| ConversionService | ‚ùå Needs Refactoring | Medium | 2-3 days |
| CompressionService | ‚ùå Needs Refactoring | High | 3-4 days |
| FileManager | ‚ö†Ô∏è To be Deprecated | Low | 1-2 days |
| FileManagementService | ‚úÖ Target Pattern | - | Complete |

## Key Benefits

- **Consistency**: Uniform file handling across all services
- **Maintainability**: Single point of file management logic
- **Testing**: Easier to mock and test file operations
- **Cleanup**: Centralized file cleanup and retention policies
- **Security**: Consistent security practices for file handling

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: OCRService (Low Risk)
- Update constructor to use FileManagementService
- Replace direct file operations
- Update error handling

### Phase 2: ConversionService (Medium Risk)
- Similar changes to OCRService
- Update all converter methods
- Comprehensive testing required

### Phase 3: CompressionService (High Risk)
- Most complex refactoring
- Persistent file handling changes
- Extensive testing with large files

### Phase 4: FileManager Deprecation (Low Risk)
- Add deprecation warnings
- Update remaining imports
- Documentation updates

### Phase 5: Test and Documentation Updates (Low Risk)
- Update all service tests
- Update integration tests
- Final documentation updates

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Phase 1: OCRService refactoring
- [ ] Phase 2: ConversionService refactoring
- [ ] Phase 3: CompressionService refactoring
- [ ] Phase 4: FileManager deprecation
- [ ] Phase 5: Test and documentation updates
- [ ] Performance validation
- [ ] Security review
- [ ] Final deployment

## Success Criteria

- All services use FileManagementService for file operations
- No direct file system operations outside of FileManagementService
- Consistent error handling across all services
- All tests pass with new implementations
- Performance benchmarks show no regression
- File cleanup works correctly across all services

## Support and Questions

For questions about this refactoring:
1. Review the relevant documentation file
2. Check the validation checklists
3. Refer to the rollback procedures if issues arise
