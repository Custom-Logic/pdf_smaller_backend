# Project Status Log

This file tracks the execution of prompts and their relationship to specification files, maintaining an overall project status.

## Completed Tasks

### 2025-01-11: Service Refactoring Specification

**Prompt Executed**: `prompts/prompt.md` (File Management Standardization Refactoring)

**Related Specifications**:
- `prompts/service_refactoring/file_management_standardization_spec.md` - Primary specification
- `prompts/service_refactoring/refactoring_tasks.md` - Detailed implementation tasks
- `prompts/service_refactoring/implementation_guidelines.md` - Guidelines and migration strategy
- `prompts/service_refactoring/README.md` - Documentation overview

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Summary**:
Created comprehensive refactoring specification for standardizing file management across all services. The specification includes:

- **Current State Analysis**: Documented existing file handling patterns in OCRService, ConversionService, CompressionService, and legacy FileManager
- **Target Architecture**: Defined standardized pattern using FileManagementService with dependency injection
- **Implementation Plan**: 5-phase migration strategy with detailed tasks for each service
- **Risk Assessment**: Identified risk levels and mitigation strategies for each phase
- **Guidelines**: Established coding standards, testing patterns, and performance guidelines

**Services Analyzed**:
- ✅ FileManagementService (target pattern)
- ❌ OCRService (needs refactoring - Low risk)
- ❌ ConversionService (needs refactoring - Medium risk) 
- ❌ CompressionService (needs refactoring - High risk)
- ⚠️ FileManager (legacy - to be deprecated)

**Next Steps**:
1. Begin Phase 1: OCRService refactoring
2. Follow implementation guidelines for consistent patterns
3. Execute migration strategy as documented

**Estimated Timeline**: 7-14 days total implementation

### 2025-01-11: AI Service Model Updates

**Task Executed**: Updated AI Service to include DeepSeek and Moonshot models

**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/ai_service.py` - Added DeepSeek and Moonshot models to supported models list
- `.env.example` - Added OpenRouter AI configuration with DeepSeek as default model

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Summary**:
Updated the AI service to include the requested DeepSeek models (including free variants) and Moonshot models:

**DeepSeek Models Added**:
- deepseek/deepseek-chat (set as new default)
- deepseek/deepseek-coder
- deepseek/deepseek-r1
- deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b
- deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b
- deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-14b
- deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-7b
- deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-1.5b

**Moonshot Models Added**:
- moonshot/moonshot-v1-8k
- moonshot/moonshot-v1-32k
- moonshot/moonshot-v1-128k

**Configuration Updates**:
- Changed default model from `openai/gpt-3.5-turbo` to `deepseek/deepseek-v3-free`
- Added comprehensive OpenRouter configuration to `.env.example`
- Organized model list with clear categorization and comments

### 2025-01-11: AI Service Model Updates (Additional)

**Task Executed**: Added Moonshot K2 and DeepSeek V3 models as requested

**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/ai_service.py` - Added DeepSeek V3 and Moonshot K2 models
- `.env.example` - Updated default model to DeepSeek V3 free

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Summary**:
Added the latest model variants as requested in the TODO comment:

**New DeepSeek V3 Models**:
- deepseek/deepseek-v3 (premium)
- deepseek/deepseek-v3-free (new default)

**New Moonshot K2 Models**:
- moonshot/moonshot-k2-free
- moonshot/moonshot-k2-premium

**Updated Configuration**:
- Changed default model to `deepseek/deepseek-v3-free` for cost optimization
- Restored all previously removed model variants
- Maintained comprehensive model categorization
