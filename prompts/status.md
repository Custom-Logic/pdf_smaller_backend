# Project Status Log

This file tracks the execution of prompts and their relationship to specification files, maintaining an overall project status.

## Completed Tasks

### 2025-01-11: Service Refactoring Specification

**Prompt Executed**: `prompts/prompt.md` (File Management Standardization Refactoring)

**Related Specifications**:
- `prompts/service_refactoring/file_management_standardization_spec.md` - Primary specification
- `prompts/service_refactoring/refactoring_tasks.md` - Detailed implementation tasks
- `prompts/service_refactoring/implementation_guidelines.md` - Guidelines and migration strategy
- `prompts/service_refactoring/README.md` - Documentation overview

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Summary**:
Created comprehensive refactoring specification for standardizing file management across all services. The specification includes:

- **Current State Analysis**: Documented existing file handling patterns in OCRService, ConversionService, CompressionService, and legacy FileManager
- **Target Architecture**: Defined standardized pattern using FileManagementService with dependency injection
- **Implementation Plan**: 5-phase migration strategy with detailed tasks for each service
- **Risk Assessment**: Identified risk levels and mitigation strategies for each phase
- **Guidelines**: Established coding standards, testing patterns, and performance guidelines

**Services Analyzed**:
- ✅ FileManagementService (target pattern)
- ❌ OCRService (needs refactoring - Low risk)
- ❌ ConversionService (needs refactoring - Medium risk) 
- ❌ CompressionService (needs refactoring - High risk)
- ⚠️ FileManager (legacy - to be deprecated)

**Next Steps**:
1. Begin Phase 1: OCRService refactoring
2. Follow implementation guidelines for consistent patterns
3. Execute migration strategy as documented

**Estimated Timeline**: 7-14 days total implementation
