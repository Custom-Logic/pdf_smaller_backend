I have created the following plan after thorough exploration and analysis of the codebase. Follow the below plan verbatim. Trust the files and references. Do not re-verify what's written in the plan. Explore only when absolutely necessary. First implement all the proposed file changes and then I'll review all the changes together at the end.

### Observations

I have thoroughly explored the tasks module and related components. The `src/tasks/` directory contains three files with `tasks.py` being the main file (1083 lines) containing all Celery task definitions. I've analyzed the task patterns, job lifecycle management, error handling, service integrations, and Celery configuration. The existing documentation follows a comprehensive markdown format with detailed sections, code examples, and structured organization.

### Approach

I'll create a comprehensive context document for the tasks module that follows the established documentation style. The document will catalog all tasks, explain the common patterns, document the job lifecycle, detail error handling strategies, and provide integration information. This will serve as a complete reference for developers working with the background task processing system.

### Reasoning

I explored the repository structure and identified the tasks module location. I read the complete `tasks.py` file to understand all task implementations and their patterns. I examined the Celery configuration in `celery_app.py`, the Job model and status management, and the custom exception hierarchy. I also reviewed existing documentation to understand the established style and format for consistency.

## Proposed File Changes

### docs\tasks_module.md(NEW)

References: 

- src\tasks\tasks.py
- src\celery_app.py
- src\models\job.py
- src\utils\exceptions.py
- docs\service_documentation.md
- docs\architecture_guide.md

Create a comprehensive context document for the tasks module that includes:

**Document Structure:**
- Title and purpose statement
- Table of contents with all major sections
- Overview of the tasks module architecture and purpose

**Task Catalog Section:**
- Complete table of all 12 tasks with columns for: Task Name, Purpose, Input Parameters, Output Format, Dependencies, Retry Policy
- Group tasks by category (Compression, Conversion, OCR, AI, Maintenance, Extraction)

**Architecture and Patterns Section:**
- Common task execution pattern used across all tasks
- Job lifecycle management (PENDING → PROCESSING → COMPLETED/FAILED)
- Progress reporting schema with `current_task.update_state` examples
- Flask application context handling via ContextTask

**Job Management Section:**
- Document the Job model from `src/models/job.py` including JobStatus enum values
- Explain job creation, status tracking, and result storage patterns
- Detail the helper methods: `mark_as_processing()`, `mark_as_completed()`, `mark_as_failed()`

**Error Handling and Retry Logic Section:**
- Document the three-tier error handling pattern used in tasks
- Create a table showing which exceptions trigger retries vs immediate failure
- Explain the retry countdown strategy (60 * retry_attempt)
- Cover database error handling and context-safe error updates

**Service Integration Section:**
- Document how tasks interact with each service (CompressionService, OCRService, etc.)
- List the main service methods called by tasks and their expected parameters
- Explain the service instantiation pattern used in tasks

**Celery Configuration Section:**
- Document the Celery app configuration from `celery_app.py`
- List task routing and queue assignments
- Explain worker settings, time limits, and retry defaults
- Document the periodic cleanup schedule

**Progress Reporting Section:**
- Standardize the progress metadata schema used across tasks
- Document the common progress stages for different task types
- Explain how clients can poll for task status

**File and Resource Management Section:**
- Document the cleanup patterns used in tasks
- Explain temporary file handling and the `_cleanup_job_files` helper
- Detail the retention policies and automatic cleanup

**Usage Examples Section:**
- Provide code examples for common task invocation patterns
- Show how to check task status and retrieve results
- Include examples of handling task failures

**Development Guidelines Section:**
- Best practices for adding new tasks
- Common patterns to follow for consistency
- Testing recommendations for task development

The document should follow the same markdown style as existing documentation with proper headings, code blocks, tables, and cross-references to related files like `src/tasks/tasks.py`, `src/celery_app.py`, and `src/models/job.py`.
