I have created the following plan after thorough exploration and analysis of the codebase. Follow the below plan verbatim. Trust the files and references. Do not re-verify what's written in the plan. Explore only when absolutely necessary. First implement all the proposed file changes and then I'll review all the changes together at the end.

### Observations

The `job_manager.py` utility is a critical component that handles database operations for job tracking with proper race condition prevention and exception handling. Currently, it lacks comprehensive documentation explaining its database-related design decisions, transaction management, and proper usage patterns. The module is widely used across the application (tasks, services, routes) but its sophisticated locking mechanisms and error handling strategies are not well documented for developers.

### Approach

I'll enhance the `job_manager.py` module with comprehensive inline documentation and create a dedicated documentation file explaining database-related issues. The approach focuses on:

1. **Enhanced Module Documentation**: Add comprehensive module-level docstring explaining the purpose, design goals, and database safety mechanisms
2. **Method Documentation**: Add detailed docstrings for all public methods with proper Args/Returns/Raises sections and usage examples
3. **Inline Comments**: Add strategic comments explaining critical database operations like row locking and transaction management
4. **External Documentation**: Create a dedicated documentation file explaining race conditions, exception handling patterns, and best practices
5. **Architecture Integration**: Update existing documentation to reference the new job manager documentation

This approach maintains all existing functionality while making the sophisticated database handling patterns clear to developers.

### Reasoning

I explored the project structure and identified the `job_manager.py` file in `src/utils/`. I examined the current implementation to understand its database operations, transaction management, and locking mechanisms. I reviewed related files including the Job model, database helpers, exception classes, and found extensive usage patterns across tasks, services, and routes. I also found existing tests that validate the current behavior, ensuring my documentation enhancements won't break existing functionality.

## Proposed File Changes

### src\utils\job_manager.py(MODIFY)

References: 

- src\models\job.py
- src\models\base.py
- src\utils\database_helpers.py
- src\utils\exceptions.py

Enhance the module with comprehensive documentation including:

1. **Module-level docstring**: Add detailed explanation of the JobStatusManager's purpose, database safety mechanisms, transaction handling, and race condition prevention strategies. Explain the design philosophy of using row-level locking with `SELECT FOR UPDATE` and explicit transaction boundaries.

2. **Method docstrings**: Add comprehensive Google-style docstrings for all public methods (`get_or_create_job`, `update_job_status`, `execute_with_job_lock`, `get_job_status`, `is_job_terminal`, `cleanup_old_jobs`) including:
   - Purpose and behavior description
   - Args section with type hints and descriptions
   - Returns section with type and description
   - Raises section documenting possible exceptions
   - Example usage snippets

3. **Inline comments**: Add strategic comments explaining:
   - Why `with_for_update()` is used for race condition prevention
   - Transaction boundary management with `db.session.begin()`
   - Exception handling and rollback strategies
   - Status transition validation logic
   - Cleanup operation safety considerations

4. **Private method documentation**: Add docstring for `_is_valid_transition` explaining the state machine logic and valid transition rules.

All changes maintain existing functionality and interfaces while making the sophisticated database handling patterns clear to developers.

### docs\job_manager_documentation.md(NEW)

References:
