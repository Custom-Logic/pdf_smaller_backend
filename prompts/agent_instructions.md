  "success": true/false,
  "data": { /* task-specific data */ },
  "confidence_score": 0.0-1.0,
  "metadata": {
    "processing_timestamp": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
    "agent_role": "agent_role_name",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  },
  "warnings": ["any warnings or uncertainties"],
  "errors": ["any processing errors"]
}
```

### Field Requirements
- **success**: Boolean indicating successful processing

## Integration Examples

### Using Agent Instructions in Code

```python
from src.services.agent_prompt_framework import AgentPromptFramework, AgentRole

# Initialize framework
framework = AgentPromptFramework()

# Build agent prompt
prompt = framework.build_agent_prompt(
    role=AgentRole.DOCUMENT_EXTRACTOR,
    task="extract_invoice_data",
    input_data={
        "file_path": "/path/to/invoice.pdf",
        "extraction_mode": "invoice",
        "options": {"include_line_items": True}
    }
)

# Validate response
validated_output = framework.validate_agent_output(
    role=AgentRole.DOCUMENT_EXTRACTOR,
    output_data=response_data
)
```
