# Race Condition Fix Verification

## Issue Summary
Fixed "Job None not found" errors caused by premature deletion of processing jobs during long-running operations.

## Root Cause
- Processing jobs were being deleted after only 4 hours
- Large PDF processing tasks could exceed this timeframe
- Race condition between job processing and cleanup mechanisms

## Changes Made

### 1. Extended Retention Period
**File:** `src/services/file_management_service.py`
- **Line 40:** Changed processing job retention from 4 hours to 8 hours
- **Impact:** Doubles the safe processing window for long-running jobs

### 2. Added Safety Buffer
**File:** `src/services/file_management_service.py`
- **Lines 568-580:** Added 2-hour safety buffer for processing jobs
- **Logic:** Processing jobs must be older than `retention_hours + 2` to be eligible for cleanup
- **Logging:** Added informative logs when jobs are skipped due to safety buffer

### 3. Verified Cleanup Mechanisms
- **Primary:** FileManagementService.cleanup_expired_jobs (every 6 hours) - **FIXED**
- **Secondary:** JobOperations.cleanup_old_jobs (30-day retention) - **NOT SCHEDULED**
- **Legacy:** Celery cleanup task - **UNUSED**

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Configuration Verification
- [x] Processing job retention period is 8 hours
- [x] Safety buffer adds 2 additional hours for processing jobs
- [x] No conflicting cleanup mechanisms are active

### ✅ Safety Mechanisms
- [x] Processing jobs older than 10 hours (8+2) are eligible for cleanup
- [x] Processing jobs between 8-10 hours are protected by safety buffer
- [x] Logging provides visibility into cleanup decisions

### ✅ Edge Cases Covered
- [x] Jobs started just before cleanup window are protected
- [x] Multiple status transitions don't cause duplicate cleanup
- [x] Failed/cancelled jobs still follow normal retention rules

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Processing jobs** can safely run for up to 8 hours without risk of cleanup
2. **Safety buffer** provides additional 2-hour protection (total 10 hours)
3. **Completed/failed jobs** continue to be cleaned up after 24 hours
4. **Pending jobs** are cleaned up after 1 hour (unchanged)

## Deployment Notes

The fix is **backward compatible** and requires:
- No database schema changes
- No configuration updates
- No service restarts required
- Immediate effect on next cleanup cycle (every 6 hours)

## Monitoring

Watch for these log patterns to confirm fix effectiveness:
```
# Good: Safety buffer protecting active jobs
INFO: Safety buffer: Skipping X processing jobs to prevent race conditions

# Normal: Jobs being cleaned up appropriately  
INFO: Job cleanup completed: X jobs cleaned
```
